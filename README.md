# IoT enabled Wheel Chair controlled using HeadGestures and have features like Pulse Detection etc.
A Head Gesture Control Wheel Chair for physically disabled.
This is basically an Arduino Based Project where i am controlling the movement of wheelchair from HEAD Gesture.

I added also the Remote control on the WheelChair and a Ultrasonic sensor to automatically detect an obstacle and stop and thinking of implementing the wheel chair control via bluetooth mobile.
